; spi_beanboard.asm - SPI byte transfer for BeanBoard via bit-bang GPIO
;
; NOTE: not currently linked into any Marvin build target. Wire up alongside
; ra8875_beanboard.asm when adding RA8875 support for the beanboard target.
;
; TODO: spi_byte is not correctly full-duplex. MOSI is driven correctly for
; each bit but MISO (GPIO_IN bit 0) is not sampled on the rising SCK edge,
; so the received byte returned in A is always 0. The bit loop needs to read
; GPIO_IN after clocking high and accumulate the received byte. Fix before
; linking this module into a build.
;
; TODO: the active SPI channel selection mechanism (how CS/RESET state
; constants are embedded in the bit patterns below) needs to be reconsidered
; when supporting multiple SPI devices on the beanboard GPIO port.
;
; Interface (PUBLIC):
;   spi_read - receive one byte (transmits 0x00); returns byte in A (unreliable - see TODO)
;   spi_byte - transmit A, receive one byte; returns byte in A (unreliable - see TODO)
